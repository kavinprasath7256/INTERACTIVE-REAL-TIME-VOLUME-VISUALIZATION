This is a simple analog LED visualizer prototype to light up clockwise or counterclockwise, creating a bar-graph or circular gauge effect. where a potentiometer (POT) is used to control a ring of LEDs arranged in a circular manner. As the knob is rotated, an equivalent number of LEDs light up in sequence and respond to knob providing a visual indication based on the potentiometer's analog input and feed back .i used 16 leds in the circular patten each one is connected to digital and analog pins of atmega328 microcontroller and the voltage feedback is connect to the analog pin of the microcontroller form potentiometer pins this can be used to Indicates knob position in machines or appliances.Moreover it Provides visual feedback in embedded systems toimproving user interaction.Eventhough this prototype is used to visualize the analog signel or volume range in amplifiers for user to identfy
